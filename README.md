Trained an autonomous AI bot that is able to play the game "Rocket League" by combining imitation learning (IL) with reinforcement (RL).
The methodology of the project is to first collect publicly available gameplay data from expert players for imitation learning. The neural network model uses this data to initially learn from professional players. Following this, the bot would be trained in a simulated environment using reinforcement learning techniques. Imitation learning uses behavioral cloning in order to learn by observing expert rocket players in the early phases of bot training. Subsequently, the bot fine-tunes its actions through rewards and penalties.
